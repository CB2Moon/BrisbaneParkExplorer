					Team captain: Chuanbin Wang.Team member: Mingkai lu, Shenda Wo, Haoing Tang. In our development's early stages, we began assigning tasks among team members. Our team leader is mainly responsible for building website code. 
					The remaining members are responsible for designing the website content. At the beginning of the project, we prepared a work plan and schedule for the whole project. Regarding project management, 
					all team members must report on their work progress and problems encountered in each meeting. Resolved and unresolved issues are shared with all team members. We also got a lot of helpful feedback from our mentors. 
					We take each feedback from different sources seriously and discuss what we can do to improve it. When any member encounters an unsolvable dilemma, all other team members will take the initiative to propose solutions.</h3>
